# Calculator with CSS Glassmorphism Effects

I get inspired by this tutorial of Irshad from Online Tutorials:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhcZh8Bwr30

This is a nice exercise of:
  - Using basic JS to manipulate elements.
  - CSS properties like: clip-path
  - Applying glassmorphism effects with soft opacities and border positions
  - Using [Vanilla-tilt.js effects](https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/)
